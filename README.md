# calorie-tracking-app
this app is class based. it helped solidify my understanding of javascript classes. this app allows users to set a daily calorie limit, track calories consumed and burned, calculate net caloric gain or loss, display remaining calories, reset daily data, add meals and workouts, and filter logged meals and workouts to manage their diet and exerciseÂ progress.
